1. Run kmeans.py using Python 3. Code has been tested on Python 3.9.5, uses numpy 1.21.2 and pandas 1.3.3. The command line argument is:
    python3 main.py
   The code creates the .jpg images of necessary plots.

2. We observe that the model, stored in NN class, reaches nearly 55% accuracy.

3. The NN class has multiple helper methods, the functionality of which has been explained inside the function definition itself, but the
    important ones are:
    a. train(): This method trains the model on the entire dataset.
    b. visualize(): This method saves and displays scatter plot visualizations of normalized and unnormalized data, as well as epoch vs
    cost and training/testing accuracies.
